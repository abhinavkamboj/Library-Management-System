Introduction
The Library Management System allows a library to manage books and patrons across multiple branches. Users can search for books, check out books, and manage their inventory in real-time across different library branches.

Features
Branch Management: Manage multiple library branches.
Book Inventory: Add, remove, and check availability of books in different branches.
Patron Management: Add patrons and track the books they borrow.
Search: Search for books by author or ISBN within a branch.
Checkout/Return: Patrons can check out and return books.

Usage
The main entry point for the application is the Main class. You can modify the library, books, and patrons directly in the Main.java file. Here’s an overview of the default setup:

Two library branches are created (Branch 1 and Branch 2).
Several books and patrons are added to the branches.
You can search for books by author or ISBN and simulate book checkouts and returns.
Example of how to add books and patrons in Main.java:

java
Copy code
Book book1 = new Book("Two States", "Chetan Bhagat", "1", 1990);
libraryBranch1.addBookInInventory(book1);

Patron patron1 = new Patron("P1", "John Doe", "johndoe@example.com", 123456789, "123 Main St");
libraryBranch1.addPatronInMemberList(patron1);
For more detailed operations, check the Main.java file.
